You've just started your adventures with Azure Infrastructure Services. Perhaps you'd like to learn more about Azure too? A great place to start is at [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/).

You have a reasonable amount of infrastructure deployed right now. To maintain control of costs, **I'd recommend you "Stop" VMs that are not being used** and simply click Start whenever you need them. **Avoid shutting VMs down from inside the VM**. You need Azure to know you are closing it down so it can stop billing you immediately. **Use the portal to "Stop" your machines**.

We hope you have enjoyed this lab, Talk to the instructor for further information or if you have any questions. If you have time try the stretch goal out below!
