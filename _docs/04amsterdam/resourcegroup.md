The infrastructure you are about to build will be in a Resource group per region. You can save a template of this when it is built, then delete the Resource group. That will delete everything you have provisioned in one action. You can easily re-provision it again using the saved template.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in using your Azure subscription credentials.

1. In the left-hand blade â€“ select **Resource groups**.

1. In the Resource groups blade, click **Add**.

1. Name: **<resource group name\>**

1. Select your subscription.

1. Set the Resource group location to "**West Europe**" then click Create.

1. Your resource group will now be created. Notice near the top right corner, the status of "creating" might be displayed. If not, click the bell icon to see when the resource group has been created.
