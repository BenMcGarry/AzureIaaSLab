Welcome to the Microsoft Technology Centres Azure Infrastructure Hands-on Lab. 

This is a self paced lab. There are no tests, no checkpoints and we won't be telling your boss how far you get. The instructions are step by step with a stretch goal at the end if you have time.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask your instructor. They will cover any logistical information for the day.

Your instructor will tell you when to proceed onto setup.
